# CSV Analysis with Django

This project is a web application built using Django, designed to handle the uploading of CSV files, perform basic data analysis on the contents, and generate visualizations that help users understand their data better.

# Features:
File Upload: Users can upload CSV files directly from their browser.
Data Processing: The CSV data is processed using pandas, a powerful Python library for data manipulation, which allows for various types of analysis.

# Data Analysis:
Displaying the first few rows of data (a preview).
Calculating summary statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
Identifying and handling missing values in the dataset.

# Data Visualization:
Histograms are generated for numerical columns to visualize the data distribution.
Other visualizations like boxplots, correlation heatmaps, and pairplots can be added to further enhance data insight.
Web Interface: The results and visualizations are displayed on a clean and user-friendly interface built with Django templates.

# How It Works:
File Upload: The user uploads a CSV file through a simple form.
Data Processing:
The CSV file is processed using pandas, and the first few rows are displayed as a preview.
The application calculates statistical summaries such as the mean, median, and standard deviation for the numerical columns.
It also checks for any missing values in the dataset and shows the user a list of columns with missing data.
# Visualization:
For numerical columns, histograms are generated and displayed on the webpage.
Additional visualizations like boxplots and correlation heatmaps can be generated based on the dataset's structure and user preferences.
User Interface: The web interface is built using Django templates and Bootstrap to ensure that the application is responsive and easy to use.

# Technologies Used:
Django: The primary web framework used for developing the application, handling routing, form submissions, and templating.
pandas: A data analysis library for reading CSV files, performing statistical calculations, and handling data.
matplotlib and seaborn: Libraries used for data visualization to generate graphs like histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps.
Bootstrap: A CSS framework used to ensure the web interface is responsive and user-friendly.

# Key Components:
File Upload Form: A form that allows users to upload CSV files to the application.
Data Preview: Displays the first few rows of the uploaded CSV to give users a quick look at the data.
Summary Statistics: Provides key statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical columns.
Missing Values Detection: Identifies which columns have missing values and shows the count of missing values in each column.
Visualizations: Histograms and other plots are displayed to help visualize the data distribution and relationships between columns.

# User-Friendly Interface: Simple, clean, and responsive web interface designed with Bootstrap for ease of use.
Installation Instructions:
Clone the repository.
Create a virtual environment and activate it.
Install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt.
Apply migrations with python manage.py migrate.
Run the development server with python manage.py runserver.
Usage:
# Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ after running the development server.
Upload a CSV file using the form provided on the webpage.
The app will display a preview of the data, statistical summaries, missing values, and generate visualizations based on the data.
Future Enhancements:
Implement additional visualizations such as pairplots and more sophisticated charts.
Add the ability to process Excel files along with CSV files.
Enhance the missing values handling to include options for filling or removing them.
Add the ability to handle larger files by using more efficient file processing techniques.
  
# Steps to follow 

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Install Required Packages

Make sure you have `pip` installed, and then run the following command to install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Navigate to your desired directory and clone the project:
cd csv_analysis

python manage.py makemigration
python manage.py runserver

Access the Application
Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to access the application.
